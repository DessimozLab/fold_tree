Tree inspector
=====================

This is a web application that allows to explore phylogenetic trees.
The tree inspector associated to this work is based on the phylo.io tree viewer.
The 3 showcase trees are the ones that are used in the
foldtree paper. The trees used for benchmarking are also included and 
are sorted into HOGs inferred to have appeared at different taxonomic levels.
