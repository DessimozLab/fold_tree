Treescore
=====================

The tree string module has a few functions that are useful for
scoring trees based on the taxonomic information in the tree. 
Trees that are more taxonomically plausible will have higher scores.

The module uses the taxonomic information from uniprot to score trees
using a recursive algorithm.  The algorithm is described in the
following paper:
