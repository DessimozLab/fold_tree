Tree inspector
=====================

We made a web application that allows to explore phylogenetic trees we inferred for this paper.

The tree inspector associated to this work is based on the phylo.io tree viewer.
The 3 showcase trees are the ones that are used in the 
foldtree manuscript. The trees used for benchmarking are also included and 
are sorted into HOGs inferred to have appeared at different taxonomic levels.

Use the top navigation bar to switch between the different  trees.
