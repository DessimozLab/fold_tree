ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -13279.276 NNIs 6 max delta 30.58 Time 0.96
      0.97 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 1 of 20
      1.07 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 7 of 20
      1.19 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 14 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.824 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
